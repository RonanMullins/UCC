                <h3>July 2021</h3>
                <h4>French production methods introduced to County Dublin</h4>

                <p>
                    Barry Buttermilk, head cheese-maker at <i>Croom Creamery</i> in County Dublin, has recently returned from a
                    fact-finding mission to France. So impressed was he with <i lang="fr">le fromage Français</i> that he intends
                    introducing French
                    production methods to his factory. Mostly these methods involve a lot of shrugging and going on
                    strike.
                </p>

                <h4>Irish cheese exports bloom</h4>

                <p>Irish cheese exports to Europe are flourishing but there are signs that the American market is
                    saturated with
                    fat.
