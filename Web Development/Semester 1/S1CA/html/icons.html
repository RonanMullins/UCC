            <h2><i>Jimi Hendrix</i></h2>
            <p><i>Jimi Hendrix</i> was one of the most influential guitarists of all time. The <i>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</i> describes <i>Jimi</i> as <b>“arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music”</b>. The <i>Seattle</i> born musician began playing the guitar at the age of 15. His first ever electric guitar was a <i>Supro Ozark</i> his father bought him in mid-1959. </p>
            <p><i>Jimi</i> is mostly associated with the <i>Fender Stratocaster</i> which he played upside down. As a left-handed player it was very difficult to find a left-handed guitar. For the longest time they didn’t exist, or they were too rare and expensive. He played mainly right-handed guitars upside-down and restrung so he could play it left-handed.</p>
            <p><i>Jimi</i> was known for his songs <i>“All Along the Watchtower”</i>, <i>“Purple Haze”</i> and <i>“Hey Joe”</i>.</p>
